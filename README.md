# BlogWithDjango
I created a blog website with the help of django, as a part of the tasks which were given to me as part of the internship by Compozent

To run the blog: change directory to iblogs

with cd iblogs

then run the server via: python manage.py runserver

You can view admin via: /admin
UserID: arpit

you can view home page by /home
